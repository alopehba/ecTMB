Description: ecTMB is a powerful and flexible statistical framework for TMB 
    estimation and classification. It uses an explicit background mutation mdoel for 
    more robust and consistent TMB prediction. The backgournd mutation model 
    takes account of unknown as well as known mutational heterogeneous factors, 
    including tri-nucleotide context, sample mutational burden, gene expression 
    level and replication timing by utilization of a Bayesian framework. The discovery
    of three TMB-based subtypes, including one novel subtype TMB-extreme, enable 
    ecTMB to classify samples to biological and clinically relavent TMB subtypes.
